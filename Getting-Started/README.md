The `/Getting-Started/` folder contains much of the foundational
information needed to get up to speed a some basic topics such as:

* [Software Install and PC setup](./Software-Installations/README.md)
* [Linux](./linux.md)
* [Git](./git.md)
* [Python](./python.md)
* [HPC](./hpc/README.md)
* [Containers](./containers/README.md)
* [Lab Imaging](./lab-imaging/README.md)

These guides are slowly getting overhauled so if you get an error just ping 
one of the devteam members on Discord (or Kijowski).
